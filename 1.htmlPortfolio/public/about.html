<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sangraj Ranjit. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal. I was born in March 17 1994.</p>
<p>I went to school named "Gautam High School" which I left after Grade 2 and moved to another school named "Holy Vision International School" where I gave my SLC exams. After that went to United College for my +2. Eventhough I was interested in IT since I was a child. I did Hotel Management for some reason during my college and also finished my Diploma in Tourism and Hotel Management from "International School of Tourism and Hotel Management". I did my internship which was 1 year in Rebak Island in Malaysia for 6 monnths and Soaltee Crown Plaza in Nepal for 6 months. After graduating from my Diploma in Hotel Management, I decided to come to Australia in 2017 for better oppurtunity as well as I decided to change my career. I did not want to be working in any hotel job so I started studing Bachelor of Information Technology in Melbourne Institute of Technology affiliated to Federation University. I completed my Bachelor of Information technology in 2021. It was lockdown time during COVID-19 so I decided to continue my study and joined Master of Information Technology in Southern Cross University. For this I moved to Perth in 2022.</p>
